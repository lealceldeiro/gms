After getting the login information successfully, this must be used in order to access protected resources.
An example of successful subsequent request using this information is the following:

Notice the _Authorization_ header sent which contains the token type (or scheme) which is _Bearer_, followed by a whitespace and the access token provided in the login information.

If a protected resource is tried to be accessed and this information is not provided properly this will result in an unsuccessful response like the one previously shown.
