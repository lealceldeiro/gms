=== Access token and Refresh token

After a period of time the access token expires and a new one need to be retrieved in order allow the user keeping performing operations over the protected resources.
A new access token can be retrieved performing a request to this endpoint providing the previously gotten refresh token.
If the refresh token also expired a new login must be performed by the user.
Usually the refresh token has a much longer expiration time.

These two parameters (access token and refresh token expiration time) are configured by your API provider.
If you are experiencing any issues regarding to this, you should put in contact.
