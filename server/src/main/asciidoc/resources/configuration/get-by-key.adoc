==== Getting a configuration value by its key

A `GET` request gets a specific configuration by providing the config key which is desired to get the value of.

In this example the key `is_server_multi_entity_app_in_server` was used to retrieved its configuration value.
The value, of course, varies depending on what it represents.
It can be any kind of object.
