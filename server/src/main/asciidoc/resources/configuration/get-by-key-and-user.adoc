==== Getting a user configuration value by its key

A `GET` request gets a specific configuration by providing the config key which is desired to get the value of and the user it is associated to.

In this example the key `language` was used to retrieved its configuration value for a specific user by providing the user `id`.
The value, of course, varies depending on what it represents.
It can be any kind of object.
